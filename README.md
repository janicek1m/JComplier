# JComplier (CIS 240: Introduction to Computer Systems Final Assignment)

J Complier is a small compiler that will transform code written in a stack-oriented language, called J, into LC4 assembly code much the way that the lcc compiler converter converts C code into assembly. The compiler generates the corresponding LC4 assembly into a file. Note: As this is a homework assignment for a live class at UPenn, no code or implementation details can be shared.
